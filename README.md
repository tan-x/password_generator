# password_generator
HW 3

Built a password generator using Javascript. User inputs a password length between 8-128 characters, selects desired character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols), and script generates a password matching the user's criteria.

Added a regenerate function that refreshes the password and matches input forms on page based on user's criteria. Input forms can be used to modify the critera outside of the prompts in the MVP generate function.
